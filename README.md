INTRO TO PHYSICAL SCIENCE BOT:
Virtual assistant is rarely applied in school to help professors and students. With a little effort, 
professors can tailor a list of questions and answers for a specific topic, a lecture, or a chapter. 
By using TTS (text to speech) libraries like "pyttsx3" or "gTTS", professors can create a virtual assistant to help students. 
This app created a virtual assistant bot to help students study Introductory of Physical Science. 
Most of important answers first come from professor's list of designated answers. 
If student asks a question out of that list, bot will use answer from wikipedia.
